# Minimal Go alternative import path packaging template.
#
# Sometimes Go projects keep importing deprecated import path names, or use
# forks with different names. Ideally, all codebases should be fixed to use the
# current canonical import path, but that is not always possible.
#
# This template documents the minimal set of spec declarations, necessary to
# publish alternative Go import paths to other packages. The sister
# “go-3-alternative import-path-full” template documents less common
# declarations; read it if your needs exceed this file.
#
# All the “go-*-” spec templates complement one another without documentation
# overlaps. Try to read them all.
#
# Simulating other import paths prevents the duplicate packaging of the a
# codebase when packagers do not notice an import path has been renamed. It
# keeps spec files that refer to the old name working. Those should still be
# fixed to use the new name as soon as possible.
