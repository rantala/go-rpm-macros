# Building Go binaries is less automated than the rest of our Go packaging and

# You need to identify manually the project parts that can be built.
# Practically, it’s any directory containing a main() Go section. You need to
# identify how the resulting binary should be named.
# Nice projects put those in “cmd” subdirectories named after the command that
# will be built, which is what we will document here, but it is not a general
# rule. Sometimes the whole “goipath” builds as a single binary.
