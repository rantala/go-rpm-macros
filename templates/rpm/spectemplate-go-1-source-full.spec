# All the “go-*-” spec templates complement one another without documentation

# A compatibility id that should be used in the package naming. It will change
# the generated “goname” to something derived from
# compat-golang-goipath-gocid-devel.
# “gocids” are used to disambiguate compatibility packages from the package
# tracking the recommended distribution version. Usual values:
#  – the version major (if different),
#  – a shortened commit tag such as
#    %{lua:print(string.sub(rpm.expand("%{?commit}"), 1, 7))}
