# Minimal Go binary packaging template.
#
# This template documents the minimal set of spec declarations, necessary to
# package Go projects that produce binaries. The sister “go-5-binary-full”
# template documents less common declarations; read it if your needs exceed
# this file.
#
# All the “go-*-” spec templates complement one another without documentation
# overlaps. Try to read them all.
#
# Building Go binaries is less automated than the rest of our Go packaging and
# requires more manual work.

# You need to identify manually the project parts that can be built, and how to
# name the result. Practically, it’s any directory containing a main() Go
# section. Nice projects put those in “cmd” subdirectories named after the
# command that will be built, which is what we will document here, but it is
# not a general rule. Sometimes the whole “goipath” builds as a single binary.
