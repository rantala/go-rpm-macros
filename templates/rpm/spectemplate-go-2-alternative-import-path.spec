# This template documents the packaging of alternative Go import paths. It does
# not repeat the documentation of the usual Go spec elements. To learn about
# those, consult the “go-0-source” template.
#
# Sometimes Go projects keep importing deprecated import path names, or use
# forks with different names. Ideally, all codebases should be fixed to use
# the current canonical import path, but that is not always possible. This
# template shows how to simulate those other names via symbolic links.
#
# The simulation is not perfect, it will fail if parts of the linked codebase
# assert the current canonical name. However it will work just as well as the
# https(s) redirects many Go projects use for the same purpose.
#
# Simulating other import paths prevents the duplicate packaging of the a
# codebase when packagers do not notice an import path has been renamed. It
# keeps spec files that refer to the old name working (even though those should
# be fixed to use the new name as soon as possible).
