The go-rpm-macros project provides files needed to automate Go (Golang) rpm
packaging:
 – default filesystem locations,
 – architecture-specific settings,
 – dependency automation (Provides, Requires, BuildRequires),
 – macros to simplify and standardize Go spec files, for all rpm build stages,
   including the srpm stage,
 – documented templates to showcase how to use the result.
